<h1> HTML, CSS, JS Coursera Week 1 Summary </h1>

<h2> hi, i am hazel.</h2>

<p> VSC hack (?): When writing a new html file, type 'html' 
	then press 'tab' to bring up the default html template. 
</p>

<h3>Git command order </h3>
<p> Check git status -> 
	git add: choose "." if everything is to be committed, 
	else specify the exact file, for e.g. "site/index.html" ->
	git commit -m "msg" -> git push </p> 

<h3>browser-sync command to run </h3>
<p>browser-sync start --server  --directory --files "*" </p>

<h3> spacing rules</h3>
<p>No spacing is allowed betweem te diamond brackets and the tag. 
	Space in between value attributes is allowed and will be ignore by the browser. 
</p>

<h3>Value Attributes</h3>
<p> for example: [ p id="myId" ] <br> Value attributes have to be unique else
	compilation error. <br> Surround values with quotes as a string. <br> 
	If using several quotes, remember to close the quotations properly. 
</p>

<h3>Self-closing tag</h3>
<p> For example: [p/] <br>
	Basically a shorthand notation for a tag that does not contain content. <br>
	But these are not allowed in HTML5 and [p][/p] needs to be used instead. 
</p>

<h3>Structure of a html page</h3>
<h4>Head tag</h4>
<p>Contains some metadata about the main content. <br> 
	Can contain author's description of the page, page title, eternal resources needed to render the page etc. <br>
	For example set [meta charset = "utf-8"] tells the browser how to interpret the content of the webpage. <br> 
	The title tag is required to be stated in the head tag. <br> 
</p>
<h4>Body Tag</h4>
<p>Often referred to as a viewport, it is the root of all content visible to user. <br>
	Content goes inside the body. 
</p>

<h3>HTML Content Models</h3>
<p>Officially, HTML5 has 7 content types. 2 notable ones are Flow Content and Phrasing Content<br>
	Flow content == Block Element ; Phrasing Content == Inline elements
</p>
<h4>Block Elements</h4>
<p>Allows other block elements and inline elements to exist within. <br>
	Requires a line on its own. 
</p>

<h4>Inline Elements</h4>
<p>Renders one the same line by default. </p>

<h3>Semantic html Element</h3>
<p>May help with search engine optimisation.</p>
<h4>Heading Tags</h4>
<p>Heading tags from 1 to 6 <br>
They signify the importance of the heading and convey the structure of the webpage.<br>
They should not be used for styling purposes as the size can be overwritten by CSS.<br> 
</p>

<h4>Other semantic tags</h4>
<p>1. Header Tag<br>
	Contains header information about the page. <br>
	The nav tag is contained within the header tag and contains links to different parts of the webpage. <br>
	2. Section and article tags <br>
	Usually, the section tag has article tags nested inside but it can work the other way round, depending on utility. <br>
	3. Aside tag <br>
	An element that contains information related to the main content but not a direct relationship. <br>
	4. Footer tag<br>
	Contains footer information.
	<br><br>
	All these tags are block level elements and they inherently contain information relating to the structure of the page.
